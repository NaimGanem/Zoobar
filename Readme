This project is a web security exercise focused on identifying and mitigating various vulnerabilities in a Flask-based web application that simulates a simple banking system using "Zoobars" as virtual currency.


Security Analysis – Explored and exploited common web vulnerabilities, including:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
SQL Injection
Session Fixation
Race Conditions in Transactions
Fixing Vulnerabilities – Implemented security patches to prevent attacks:

Parameterized Queries to protect against SQL Injection.
CSRF Tokens to secure transactions.
Input Sanitization to mitigate XSS.
Session Management Improvements to prevent fixation attacks.
Concurrency Controls to prevent race conditions in money transfers.
Sandboxing & Privilege Separation – Improved system isolation to minimize security risks.

Authentication & Authorization Hardening – Strengthened access control mechanisms.

Logging & Monitoring – Enhanced security monitoring and logging to detect potential threats.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience in web security, ethical hacking, and secure coding practices.
